<h1>Tired Walk in Space</h1>
<div id="author">by: Yixin He (yixinh)</div>
<p>Walk on different geometric landscapes and find the bed of your dreams as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- the <div> wrapping this image centers it on the page. -->
<!-- TODO: drawing showing the main view of the game during play -->
Land is heavily inspired by Mike Creighton's project "None of This Was Real."
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>You're a little dude walking on some weirdly shaped land (generated by scripting in blender), looking for a place to rest. You want to find the perfect sized bed (some are too big, some are too small) and there are bear like things (henceforth called bhings) floating around. </p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The game starts with the player at a random point on the map. The player uses arrow keys to walk, hold shift to run, and the space key for interactions (with beds and bhings).

There is a countdown timer for how long you have to reach the bed before you become too exhausted and sleep on the ground (the equivalent of game over). 

When interacted with Bhings either offer advice, or waste your time, or attempt to chase you down(game over if they succeed). 

The game is finished when you find a bed that is a good size for sleeping on. </p>

 Bhings to be modeled later, if time constraints then bhings will become this goose I modeled for the previous game.
